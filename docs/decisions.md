# Decisions and findings

Anything that changed the approach, or that a future session would otherwise have to
rediscover. Newest last.

---

## D1 — Fidelity target: faithful now, enhancements opt-in later (2026-10-10)

Accepted: same 320×200 / 320×400 indexed output, same fixed-point maths, same palette
and timing. Target pixel-identical to the original, verified by frame-diffing against
emulator captures. A small number of documented approximations are permitted where an
effect lives inside esoteric generated assembly. The renderer leaves a seam for an
optional enhanced mode later.

Rejected: strictly pixel-perfect (would require a VGA register-level emulation layer
and hand-decompiling multi-thousand-line unrolled assembly); modern remake (different
visual identity).

## D2 — Scope: full demo + hidden part + dev-parts vault (2026-10-10)

Accepted: the 20-part sequence, the hidden DDSTARS part, a modern replacement for the
DOS setup screen, and a vault menu exposing the three unreleased development effects
(GRID, HARD, TWIST).

Rejected: main sequence only (leaves GRID/HARD/TWIST unported).

## D3 — Architecture: software VGA model + per-part modules (2026-10-10)

Accepted: a small engine layer owning an indexed surface, a per-scanline palette, a
view transform replacing the CRTC, a fixed 70.086 Hz tick, and a `Part` trait replacing
the DIS interrupt server. Parts are ordinary Rust modules writing indexed pixels.

Rejected: flat framebuffer with per-part special cases (pushes hardware concepts into
a dozen parts, makes frame-diffs harder); instruction-level emulation (not a port).

## D4 — Pixel aspect: 4:3 default, square-pixel toggle (2026-10-10)

Accepted: default to 4:3 with rectangular pixels, matching a VGA monitor. Square-pixel
16:10 available as a setting.

Rejected: square pixels only (what the existing C++ ports do — geometrically wrong);
4:3 only (no flexibility).

## D5 — The music pattern data is scrambled, and the keystream is recovered (2026-10-10)

**Finding.** `MAIN/MUSIC0.S3M` and `MUSIC1.S3M` (byte-identical copies of what is
embedded in `REALITY.FC`) are standard S3Ms in every respect — header, instrument
tables, correct pattern pointer table tiling on 16-byte boundaries, plain PCM samples —
**except that the packed pattern data is XOR-scrambled.** Stock S3M decoders fail.

**Keystream.** For byte index `i` within a pattern's packed data, from 0 at `ptr+2`,
restarting per pattern:

```
n      = (i >> 1) + 1
key(i) = (((n ^ (n >> 2)) << 3) | ((5*i + 2) & 7)) & 0xFF
```

XOR for `i` in `0 .. ln-2`. Verified 77/77 patterns for MUSIC0, 76/77 for MUSIC1, zero
invalid commands, and the resulting effect histogram reproduces an independently
derived one exactly.

**Two traps found while verifying:** S3M command bytes are ST3 numeric (1–26 = A–Z,
0x30–0x39 = digits), not ASCII; and note bytes are `(octave << 4) | semitone`, valid up
to 0x9B.

**Consequence:** the music is not a research spike; it is roughly ten lines of
descrambling plus a normal ST3-semantics player. This materially reduced Phase 3.

## D6 — Do not copy the C++ ports' shortcuts (2026-10-10)

`SecondRealityW32` and `SecondRealityPlusPlus` stub `dis_setcopper()` to nothing and
upload one palette per frame per whole screen. Consequence: they lost the techno part's
interference seam, a visible quarter-screen discontinuity where the beam catches the
screen mid-redraw. They also widen the palette to 8-bit and spin-wait to 70 Hz.

Adopted instead: preserve the three copper callbacks; keep the palette at 6-bit
precision; fixed timestep decoupled from display refresh; and add **beam compose** —
optional scanline-banded rendering so a part's per-frame work is committed to the
output as the beam would have drawn it.

Also noted: `SecondRealityW32` stubs `dis_muscode()` to `return 0`, so the parts that
wait on it must have been patched. We will implement it properly.

## D7 — Preserve the original's bugs (2026-10-10)

The GMX plasma's palette-leak banding and the no-z-buffer particle overdraw are part of
the visual identity. A "correct" implementation looks wrong. These are recorded as
required behaviour in `docs/fidelity/bugs.md` with reference frames.

## D8 — Open: `_np_zinfo` (2026-10-10)

`dis_muscode()` returns STMIK's `_np_zinfo`, which is not present in the module data
(all `S` commands are standard `SDx`; MUSIC0 has no cells outside channels 0–7;
MUSIC1's only off-channel cells are five near-empty ones on channels 10–14). Exposure:
BEGLOGO waits for `0xf0`, GRID for 1/2/3, HARD for 1 and 0xff.

Resolution ladder: (1) parse `STMIK.300`'s OMF symbol records for `_np_zinfo` /
`_np_zplus` offsets, then read them live from the emulated original via
`dosbox-automation`'s memory API and correlate against order/row; (2) read `st3play`'s
source for the semantics of "plus flags"; (3) disassemble the STMIK segment.

Escalation trigger: if route 1 fails within Phase 3, implement affected parts against a
substitute cue and record the difference. Do not let it block the phase.

## D11 — The reference oracle is verified end-to-end (2026-10-10)

Supersedes the "still unverified" caveat in D10. The emulator's REST API was exercised
successfully. **Working invocation:**

```
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<repo>/build/release-linux/_deps/{sdl3,sdl3_image,mt32emu,fluidsynth,zlib-ng,iir1}-build
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy
DOSBOX_API_TOKEN=<64 hex chars>
dosbox-automation --noprimaryconf --set webserver_enabled=true
```

Three gotchas, all found the hard way:

1. **The API token must be exactly 64 hex characters.** `DOSBOX_API_TOKEN` with any
   other length is rejected with `WARN: DOSBOX_API_TOKEN set but invalid (need 64 hex
   chars)` and the emulator silently generates its own. Requests then fail with 401.
2. **The log masks the token** (`API token: a4b00e48...`), so it cannot be scraped from
   stdout for a full-length token. There is an alternative — `webserver_token_file` —
   but supplying the token ourselves is better: deterministic, and no file to manage.
   Our spawner generates 64 hex chars, passes them via the environment, and uses the
   same value in the `Authorization: Bearer` header.
3. **Port 8386, bound to 127.0.0.1** by default; remote binding requires
   `webserver_allow_remote=true`.

**Headless operation works.** `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy` runs the emulator with no window,
which is what automated capture needs — no GUI stealing focus during a test run.

**Confirmed capabilities** from `GET /api/v1/dosbox/info`:

```json
"features": { "cpu_control": true, "cpu_registers": true, "debugger": false,
              "freeze": true, "input": true, "memory": true, "port_io": true }
```

All four capabilities the design depends on are present:

- `cpu_control` — pin cycles so captures are reproducible (§8.1)
- `input` — scripted input sequences
- `video/frame` — frame grabs (endpoint present in the OpenAPI document)
- `memory` — **live variable inspection, which is the primary route for resolving
  `_np_zinfo` (§7.4 route 1). This is now a confirmed capability, not an assumption.**

`debugger` is false, so there is no interactive debugger — consistent with the design
never having depended on one.

## D9 — Licence: MIT (2026-10-10)

The new Rust code is MIT licensed, in the same permissive spirit as the original, which
is public domain under the Unlicense. Applies to new source only; the vendored
`upstream/SecondReality` submodule and the media copied into `assets/` stay under
Unlicense/public-domain terms, which impose no conditions on redistribution.

Phase 0 sets `license = "MIT"` in the workspace and crate manifests.

## D10 — The reference oracle is behind a trait, not a hard dependency (2026-10-10)

The `dosbox-automation` binaries on this machine did not run. Diagnosed: the build at
`dosbox-automation/build/release-linux/` succeeds and produces the executable, but it
has no rpath to its own vcpkg-style dependencies, so `libSDL3.so.0`,
`libSDL3_image.so.0`, `libmt32emu.so.2` and `libiir.so.1` are not found. All four *are*
built, under `build/release-linux/_deps/*-build/`. Supplying

```
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<repo>/build/release-linux/_deps/{sdl3,sdl3_image,mt32emu,fluidsynth,zlib-ng,iir1}-build
```

makes it run — confirmed, reports `dosbox-automation version 0.85.1 (6d100)`.

**Do not use `cmake --install` to make this permanent.** Verified: the fetched
dependencies carry install rules (`sdl3` 12, `sdl3_image` 12, `mt32emu` 39, `iir1` 41,
`fluidsynth` 17) and `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is `/usr/local`, so a default install would
place SDL3, mt32emu, iir1, fluidsynth and their headers system-wide. It also would not
reliably fix the binary: `readelf -d` shows the executable has **no `RPATH`/`RUNPATH` at
all**, so installing to `/usr/local/lib` still depends on the system linker being
configured to search there.

**Chosen approach: `xtask` sets `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on the child process.** The emulator is
spawned programmatically, so its environment can be set at spawn time. No wrapper
script, no system modification, no `patchelf`. The workaround lives in our code where
it is discoverable and reviewable, rather than in a shell script somebody must remember
to use. If a standalone runnable binary is ever wanted, the contained options are
`cmake --install --prefix <project-local-dir>` or rebuilding with
`-DCMAKE_BUILD_RPATH=<_deps build dirs>`; neither touches `/usr/local`.

**Design consequence, independent of whether that fix sticks:** `xtask reference
capture` sits behind a small trait rather than depending on one emulator, so an
unusable oracle degrades to a documented alternative instead of blocking a phase.
Fallback order: locally built `dosbox-automation`; DOSBox-X with scripted commands and
screenshots; DOSBox-staging.

Important consequence for sequencing: **the oracle is only needed for verification.**
Engine work and part implementation do not block on it — only the frame-diff gates in a
phase's exit criteria do. Phase 0 must therefore be planned so that its engine and
synthetic-test-card work can complete even if no oracle is available, with the
reference-capture deliverable explicitly separable.
